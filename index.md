### Cloud and Devops Learning Projects

1. [ec2 LAMP stack ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project1/project1.md) Spin-up an ec2 instance and deploy a LAMP stack.   

2. [ec2 LEMP stack ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project2/project2.md) Spin-up an ec2 instance and deploy a LEMP stack.

3. [ec2 MERN stack ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project3/project3.md) Spin-up an ec2 instance and deploy a MERN stack.

4. [ec2 MEAN stack ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project4/project4.md) Spin-up an ec2 instance and deploy a MEAN stack.

5. [ec2 Client Server](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project5/project5.md) Spin-up two ec2 instances in the same VPC. Install mysql-server on one of them and make the necessary changes so that mysql-client on the other instance could connect to the remote database.

6. [ec2, ebs, and wordpress](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/project6/project6.md) Spin-up two ec2 instances, give them both 3 ebs volumes. Create partitions, physical volumes, logical volume groups on all of them. Then install and configure mysql on one instance, and wordpress on the other instance.

7. [ec2, ebs, nfs, ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project7/project7.md) Spin-up five ec2 instances, Configure one of them as a database server, 3 of them as webservers, and the remaining one is an nfs server for the others.

8. [ec2, ebs, nfs, load balancer ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project8/Project8.md) Using the set-up from project7. Add another ec2 instance and configure apache loader balancer on it to act as a load balancer for the web servers. Verify that the site can be logged into by browsing to the public dns of the laod balancer, and check the web server access log files to confirm that the round-robin load balncing policy is working correctly.

9. [ec2, ebs, nfs, jenkins ](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project9/project9.md) Building upon the infrastructure for project8, add another ec2 instance running ubuntu, and configure it to be a jenkins build server that publishes artefacts to the nfs server.

10. [ec2, nginx, load balancer](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project10/project10.md) Taking the infrastructrure from project8 and replacing the apache load balancer with an nginx load balancer. Registering a new domanin, pointing it at the elastic IP address of the load balancer, and securing the site with a new SSL/TLS certificate

11. [ec2, jenkins, ansible, ansible roles, git](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project11/project11.md) A small project proof of concept setting up a new github repo with webhooks to trigger a jenkins build, and then use the deployed artefacts to run an ansible playbook to install wireshark on the remaining serves from previous projects  

12. [ec2, nginx, jenkins, ansible, github](https://github.com/andycthomas/dareyio-pbl/blob/main/Project12/project12.md) Refactoring the anisble playbooks from project11 and introducing an ansible role.
